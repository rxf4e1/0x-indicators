* INTRO
Simple collection of scripts made by me for me.
These are not for distribute, but if you fall into this repo, feel
free to try it out. Don´t bother creating PR because i probably will
not see or change it, unless i feel i want to.

* Indicators
** Moving-Avarages
0x-MA shows three mostly used, at leat by me, moving avarages, and for
the supersticious one, it follows Fibonacci progression.

** SuperTrend-StoRSI-VWAP
 0x-WaveTrend+Stoch[RSI]+vwap displays a lot of useful information for
 the one who knows how to use it. That’s all for now, since i’m pretty
 lazy to write it’s doc, will leave it for some other day.
 
* TODO Strategies
No strategies have been developed yet, actually i have only some
studies that doesn’t worth uploading.
